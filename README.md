# Weather_Classification_Project
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify weather conditions based on images. By leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the project aims to accurately categorize images into different weather categories such as sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy.
